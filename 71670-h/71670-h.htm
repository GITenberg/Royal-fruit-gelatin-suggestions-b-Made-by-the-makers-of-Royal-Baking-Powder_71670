<p><em>From Oklahoma</em>—“We served
raspberry for dinner and we were
more than delighted. It is delicious.
Royal Fruit Gelatin has completely
won our hearts.”</p>

<p><em>In Massachusetts they say</em>—“It is
delicious and all that you claim for
it, and I shall certainly use it after
this.”</p>

<p>“Your gelatin is better than any
other brand. The orange gelatin
was especially good and the flavor
exactly like the fresh fruit. If I had
held an orange in one hand and the
opened box of gelatin in the other,
it would have been hard to tell by
smell which was which,” <em>writes an
enthusiast in Pennsylvania</em>.</p>

<p><em>They love it in Ohio!</em>—“I am writing
to express my satisfaction with
the real fruit flavor, and to say it is
the finest thing in the gelatin line I
have ever had. The children are
saying ‘please get some more!’
Where can I buy it?”</p>

<p><em>In New York State</em>—“I found
Royal Gelatin far superior to the
brand I have been using, as it is
tastier and lends itself well to the
adding of fruit,” <em>writes one delighted
woman</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> fresh, fragrant aroma, that
greets you the moment you
open the package—how delicious
it is—how different from any
gelatin you have ever bought before.
You recognize its distinction
with the first whiff—it’s the very
aroma of the sun-ripened fresh fruits
themselves.</p>

<p>Pour a little of it into your hand.
Note the rich heaviness of the delicate
fruit-flavored crystals. Empty
the package into a bowl, and pour
on the boiling water—Ah! Just
smell the rich fragrance!
Like ripe fruit, warm
with sunshine and
drenched with dew.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i03b.jpg" alt="Woman stirring in a bowl">
</figure>

<p>Taste these new gelatins
carefully—roll them
on your tongue. There
is no strange flavor—no
“manufactured” taste at
all. Not the faintest
trace of “gummy” taste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
or “gluey” smell.
The pure gelatin that
carries these fresh fruit
flavors does not alter
their delicacy, their aroma, in any
way. For no synthetics or artificial
flavorings are used. And pure, perfect
gelatin of itself is neutral to
taste and smell.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90 bold"><em>Real fruit flavors made from<br>
fresh fruits</em></p>

<p>Royal Raspberry—ripe, luscious,
melting, like the very berries from
whose juice its flavor comes.</p>

<p>Royal Strawberry—hold
it to the light! It’s
the real strawberry
shade—gleaming, perfect.
And its flavor—straight
from the juice
of that most perfect fruit.</p>

<p>Sniff the cherry-ripe
fragrance that rises as
you melt the crystals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Royal Cherry—gleaming, dancing
under the leaves, playing hide and
seek with the sunshine ... that’s the
way the juice from which this flavor
is made is ripened and sweetened.</p>

<p>Royal Orange with its golden
beauty—Royal Lemon, clear, translucent,
pure ... with
the delicious flavor and
fragrance only the
fruits themselves can
give—how delectable
they are.</p>
<br>

<p class="fs90 bold"><em>And for health....</em></p>

<p>Famous food specialists
everywhere
recommend gelatin as
an integral part of a
balanced diet. As a
source of protein, a principle of
growth, an active aid to digestion, it
has its established place.</p>

<p>It is especially desirable for children—and
how they love it! While
to the housewife, it is a delicious
dessert that may be made in a
minute—yet capable of so many
toothsome changes that “time cannot
stale its infinite variety.” Nor
(blessed thought!) in spite of its
charm to a sweet tooth, is it fattening
at all!</p>

<p>Of course you want the very
purest gelatin in the world! On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
general principles, and because it’s
so invaluable for children. You
know you can trust Royal Fruit
Flavored Gelatin quality ... because
for years you have used Royal Baking
Powder, and know its superlative
standard. Royal Fruit Flavored Gelatin
is made by the same standards
of quality and purity.</p>

<p>You’ll be delighted
with its delicate texture,
smooth, tender,
firm, and, with its lovely
color, as appetizing
to look at, as to taste.
And then it’s so quick!
Hundreds of delighted
women have written
to tell us that it sets
more quickly than any
other gelatin they have ever used. For
making whipped desserts, they tell
us it is wonderful. “It whips just like
cream” “and so easily and quickly.”</p>

<p>You’ll notice, and enjoy, the difference
too!</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90 bold"><em>With confidence....</em></p>

<p>We introduce Royal Fruit Flavored
Gelatin to our Royal Baking Powder
friends with complete confidence,
and especial pride. We are sure that
the same discriminating taste that insists
upon consistent perfection, will
give it the sure and lasting welcome
that Royal Baking Powder has
always received.</p>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>The Package, The Utensils and<br>
Just How to Get Perfect Results</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Each</span> package of Royal Fruit Flavored
Gelatin weighs 3¼ ozs. and measures
½ cup or 8 tablespoons.</p>

<p>Each package of 3¼ ozs. calls for
two cups or one pint water or other liquid and
makes over one pint jelly, or sufficient to serve
six persons.</p>

<p>In order to save time and shorten the cooling
process, one cup boiling water is used to
dissolve the gelatin and one cup cold water or
other liquid to cool it, but if preferred, the two
cups boiling water can be added at once.</p>

<p>If you desire to use a portion of a package
at any time, dissolve two level tablespoons
Royal Fruit Flavored Gelatin in ½ cup boiling
water and this amount can be moulded in a
custard cup and is sufficient for one large
serving.</p>

<p>When a portion of a package of Royal Fruit
Flavored Gelatin is left, close tightly as possible
and keep in a dry place until ready to use.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Utensils for Measuring, Dissolving,<br>
Moulding and Chilling Royal<br>
Fruit Flavored Gelatins</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">
Kettle for boiling water<br>
Bowl for holding the Gelatin<br>
Measuring cup<br>
Spoon for stirring<br>
Mould or bowl or cup for setting the Gelatin<br>
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In measuring</span> the liquid it is important
to use the standard measuring cup holding
½ pint or its equivalent, as the consistency of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the finished Gelatin depends upon the amount
of water or other liquids used.</p>

<p>Stir the mixture well after boiling water is
added so all will be dissolved. Then add cold
water.</p>

<p>For Whipped Desserts the rotary egg beater
is best and saves much time.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Moulds</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> are on the market, tin, aluminum
and china moulds in varying shapes and
sizes. If there is no mould at hand, ordinary
bowls, custard cups or even plain cups can
be used very successfully for moulding Royal
Fruit Flavored Gelatins.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Chilling</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> quickest way to chill Royal Fruit Flavored
Gelatins is in the ice box. To shorten
the stiffening process still further, set mould in
pan filled with cracked ice, rock salt and water.</p>

<p>In cold weather, the mould, covered, can be
placed on outside window sill. Royal Fruit
Flavored Gelatins chilled in this way will stiffen
in a remarkably short time; in some cases in
one-half to three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Removing Gelatin From Moulds</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dip</span> mould very quickly into bowl or pan
of hot water. Loosen carefully from sides
of mould with a knife; place plate or serving
dish over top and quickly turn upside down.
The mould can then be lifted carefully without
spoiling the shape or design.</p>

creature, the

used to separate the generations. Belinda is
firm friends with her grandmother, and her

they face the world with a friendly affectionate
dignity, a reasonable freedom and a
healthy ease, that banishes boredom,—lengthens

<p>Gone, too, are the cumbrous clumsy methods
of housekeeping—basement kitchens, hods
of coal, oil lamps and 24-hour bread.... Vanished
with the high bicycles and Waspwaists
of the “Gay Nineties.”</p>

to build a pleasant place, and welcome those
you love within its walls—remains the same
to-day as it has been forever.</p>

<p>Belinda loves these gelatin desserts, because
they always arrive at her table cool, interesting,
tender, gleaming with color and distinguished
in taste, with an endless variety to
add to their charm.... Doesn’t that sound
like a description of Favorite Friends? Belinda
looks on them as F.F’s ... and loves them
also for their priceless power of satisfying her
taste for sweets, without adding an inch to
her figure. Because—blessed thought—they
are not fattening at all!</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>The Little Dinners</em></p>

<p class="no-indent">that delight the hearts of men and make the
perfect setting for a charming woman ... these
are the acid test for the clever hostess.</p>

<p>Belinda has a <em>flair</em> for these intimate occasions.
She gives them an atmosphere.</p>

<br>

<p>Belinda chooses guests that harmonize, with
the same care that she gives to choosing
flowers that blend with the gown she wears.
Decorative touches on the dinner table perhaps
... gay little place cards or favors, a
scented leaf or blossom floating in each finger
bowl, tall glasses on twisted stems that give
a touch of dignity ... candle light ... comfort.</p>

<p>Whether Belinda cooks and serves the dinner
single handed, or has a staff of servants,
she follows the rule of good breeding that
serves only what can be perfectly cooked and
served, without confusion.</p>

<p>The hot things hot—the cold things cold—sounds
an obvious rule. But more meals than
can be counted have been wrecked by neglect
of it.</p>

<p>Belinda has carefully chosen menus for a
little dinner that can be served to perfection
by a single maid, whose mistress helps with
the preparation.</p>

<p>Belinda thinks that gelatin, with its countless
combinations and variations, makes the
perfect dessert. Delicious, delicate ... an aid
to the digestion rather than a tax upon it.
Perfectly prepared, dished, garnished, before
the last minute cookery begins.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>The Children’s Hour</em></p>

<p>Gelatin seems to have been invented by
some Fairy Godmother who studied children’s
tastes and parents’ dietetic duties. And
merged them into the delicate fruity crystals
that bring protein and growth-promoting
elements, to the active little bodies, while
actually helping the digestive process.</p>

<p>How the children love them too, these desserts
that look like jewels ... fairy bubbles
that melt in the mouth ... delectable as the
fresh fruit from which their flavors are made!</p>

<p>They “make a party” of the simplest meal
... whipped or plain, with custard or with
cream. Raspberry, Strawberry, Orange,
Lemon, or Cherry ripe—their very names
carry the fragrance of a sunlit garden.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

</div>
<div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>
<div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div>
<div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

<div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>
<div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>
<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>
<div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>
<div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>
<div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>
<div>
1.F.
</div>
<div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>
<div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>
<div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>
<div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>
<div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>
<div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div>
<div>

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
